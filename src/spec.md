# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated, offline-first “Sleep Performance” pillar with a tactical, mission-focused sleep dashboard, daily flow, modes, mapping, and actionable tools.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new top-level “Sleep Performance” section with equal prominence in main navigation and distinct routes/pages from existing readiness/daily dashboard areas.
- Build a Daily Sleep Performance Dashboard showing last sleep window, rolling sleep debt, estimated cognitive readiness %, injury risk indicator, and emotional regulation impact with soldier-credible explanatory language and Field Mode usability.
- Implement a daily flow (check-in → analysis → action) that stores all Sleep Performance data locally (device-scoped, offline-first) and updates dashboard outputs when sleep inputs are logged/edited.
- Add selectable Tactical Sleep Modes (Field, Garrison, Shift/CQ/Staff Duty, High-Stress/Post-Event) that persist locally and dynamically adjust action guidance (sleep duration expectations, naps, caffeine timing, wind-down protocols).
- Create a Sleep Debt → Readiness mapping that tracks cumulative debt over a defined rolling window and outputs quantified performance degradation estimates for reaction time, PT injury risk, emotional volatility, and judgment errors.
- Add optional Pain-Aware Sleep Optimization inputs (neck pain, back pain, nerve symptoms) with tailored positioning/pillow guidance, short micro-routines, and neutral red-flag escalation prompts.
- Add a Caffeine & Stimulant Timing tool for logging sources and estimating clearance windows and recommended last intake times relative to planned sleep.
- Add tools and guidance within Sleep Performance: Nervous System Downshift routines (2–5 min), Micro-Naps & Controlled Rest options (10/20/30/90 min) with wakeup/reactivation guidance, and Stress-Related Sleep Disruption Support check-ins with immediate tools and follow-up suggestions.
- Add Command-Safe Education Tiles with short, shareable, factual operational content and a simple “copy/share text” affordance.
- Integrate sleep-focused gamification (consistency streaks, readiness improvements tied to sleep behavior, and at least one unlockable sleep tool) stored locally and usable offline.
- Add/ensure soldier-oriented, mission-framed microcopy throughout Sleep Performance (at least 10 distinct pieces), avoiding wellness framing and any shaming language.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a new “Sleep Performance” pillar from the main navigation, log sleep and related optional inputs, see a tactical dashboard with quantified readiness impacts, get mode-adjusted actions and tools (naps, caffeine timing, downshift routines, pain-aware guidance, stress disruption support), view/share command-safe education tiles, and track local streaks/unlocks—all usable offline and in Field Mode.

    title: 'What is IZOF?',
    content: `The Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF) is a performance concept that recognizes each person has a unique stress level where they perform best.

Too little stress and you're under-aroused—sluggish, unfocused, lacking intensity. Too much stress and you're over-aroused—tense, scattered, making errors. Your optimal zone is the sweet spot where you're alert, focused, and ready to execute.

IZOF is not about eliminating stress. It's about finding and training your personal zone for peak performance under pressure.`,

  eustressVsDistress: {
    title: 'Eustress vs Distress',
    content: `Not all stress is bad. Understanding the difference is critical:

**Eustress (Helpful Stress):**
• Sharpens focus and reaction time
• Increases motivation and energy
• Enhances performance and decision-making
• Feels challenging but manageable
• Example: Pre-mission adrenaline that keeps you sharp

**Distress (Harmful Stress):**
• Impairs judgment and coordination
• Causes fatigue and burnout
• Degrades performance over time
• Feels overwhelming and uncontrollable
• Example: Chronic sleep deprivation and overtraining

The goal is to harness eustress and mitigate distress. Your IZOF is where eustress works for you.`,
  },

  individuality: {
    title: 'Your Zone is Unique',
    content: `There is no universal optimal stress level. What works for one soldier may not work for another.

Some perform best with high arousal—high-intensity, fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled. Others excel with moderate arousal—calm, controlled, methodical.

Your IZOF depends on:
• Your personality and temperament
• The specific task or mission
• Your training and experience level
• Your current physical and mental state

This app helps you identify your personal zone through repeated self-assessment and performance tracking. Over time, you'll learn to recognize when you're in your zone and how to get there.`,

  examples: {
    title: 'Real-World Examples',
    content: `**Soldier Example:**
A squad leader preparing for a live-fire exercise notices they perform best when their pre-exercise stress is around 6/10. Below 4, they feel sluggish and miss details. Above 8, they overthink and second-guess decisions. They use breathing techniques to stay in their 5-7 zone.

**Elite Athlete Example:**
An Olympic sprinter tracks their pre-race anxiety. They discover their best times occur when they feel "nervous but excited" (7/10 stress). Too calm (3/10) and they lack explosive power. Too anxious (9/10) and they tense up and false-start. They use music and visualization to dial into their zone.

**Key Takeaway:**
Both the soldier and the athlete use self-awareness and regulation skills to consistently access their optimal zone. You can do the same.`,

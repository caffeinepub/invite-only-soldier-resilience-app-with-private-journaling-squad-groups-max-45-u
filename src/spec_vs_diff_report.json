  "summary": "The diff modifies `AppShell.tsx` to introduce a persistent header with a hamburger button and a stateful drawer (`isDrawerOpen`). The truncated `AppShell.tsx` plus the provided file summary indicate a full-width slide-in drawer with scrim and close behaviors, while preserving the Life Lessons nav path. No unrequested features are clearly evidenced beyond the requested navigation update.",

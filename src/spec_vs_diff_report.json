  "summary": "The diff removes the Life Lessons nav item from the sidebar and introduces a new removal/placeholder page intended to replace the old experience at the same route. However, motivational-video-specific modules/content/hooks appear to remain in the codebase (and even a new motivational-video validation utility was added), so full decommissioning/cleanup (REQ-7) is not evidenced by the diff summary. The diff also includes substantial unrelated feature work beyond the requested removal.",

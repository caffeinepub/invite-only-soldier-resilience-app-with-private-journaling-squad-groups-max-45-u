  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear largely implemented via a new Settings/About share card, a single-source production URL config, clipboard copy with toast feedback, and QR rendering + PNG download. However, the diff introduces an external QR-code generation API dependency and backend “liveLink” state / (implied) live-link API that were not requested, and the backend method `getLiveLink()` is not evidenced in the provided backend diff excerpt.",

      "description": "Adds backend-side 'liveLink' state (and frontend hook logic to fetch `actor.getLiveLink()`), implying a new backend endpoint/feature for retrieving the live link.",
      "reason": "REQ-1 specifies the production URL should be captured in a single configurable place in the frontend; it does not request adding or depending on a backend-provided live link value.",

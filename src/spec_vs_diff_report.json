  "summary": "The diff updates the motivational video dataset with real YouTube URLs/thumbnails for at least several entries, but the dataset file is truncated so it’s not possible to verify that *all* placeholder URLs were removed.

      "reason": "The only required change is in frontend/src/content/mentalPerformance/motivationalLifeLessonsVideos.ts, but the diff for this file is truncated; it shows some entries updated to real YouTube URLs, but does not provide enough evidence that *all* placeholder URLs throughout the dataset were replaced and that none remain.",
